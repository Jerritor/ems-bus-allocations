# RELEVANT FILES FOR ALLOCATIONS
These models will be used in the final bus allocator application.

#### Run the following files on Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to generate bus allocations:
- ip incoming model.ipynb
- ip outgoing model.ipynb

### Differences in Models:
- The outgoing model only allows one bus to be deployed on a hybrid route
- The incoming model allows any number of buses to be deployed on hybrid routes
